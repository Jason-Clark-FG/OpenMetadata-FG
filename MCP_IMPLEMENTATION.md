# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in OpenMetadata, including the architectural decisions, current state, and remaining work.

## Architecture Design

### Initial Design (Embedded Entities)
The original implementation attempted to use embedded entities where McpTool, McpResource, and McpPrompt were embedded within the McpService entity. This approach had several issues:
- Complex JSON schema relationships
- Difficulty with CRUD operations on individual tools/resources/prompts
- Limited extensibility

### Current Design (Separate Entities)
The implementation has been refactored to follow the OpenMetadata API Services pattern with separate entities:

```
McpService (Parent Entity)
├── McpTool (Child Entity) 
├── McpResource (Child Entity)
└── McpPrompt (Child Entity)
```

Each entity has:
- Its own repository class
- Its own resource (REST API) class
- Its own DAO interface
- Proper relationships managed through the CONTAINS relationship type

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **MCP Service Management**
   - Create, Read, Update, Delete MCP services
   - Configure MCP server connections (stdio, SSE, etc.)
   - Store server instructions and configuration

2. **MCP Tool Management**
   - CRUD operations for tools associated with MCP services
   - Support tool categories, input/output schemas
   - Tool discovery and listing by service

3. **MCP Resource Management**
   - CRUD operations for resources exposed by MCP services
   - Support resource URIs, MIME types, metadata
   - Resource discovery and access control

4. **MCP Prompt Management**
   - CRUD operations for prompts provided by MCP services
   - Support prompt templates, arguments, examples
   - Prompt discovery and parameter validation

### Technical Requirements
1. Follow OpenMetadata entity patterns
2. Support full CRUD operations via REST APIs
3. Maintain referential integrity between services and components
4. Enable search and discovery
5. Support versioning and change tracking
6. Implement proper access control

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed

1. **Core Entity Structure**
   - Created separate JSON schemas for McpTool, McpResource, and McpPrompt
   - Removed embedded entities from McpService schema
   - Added proper entity references and relationships

2. **Repository Layer**
   - Implemented McpToolRepository, McpResourceRepository, McpPromptRepository
   - Added proper relationship management (CONTAINS relationship)
   - Implemented EntityUpdater subclasses for change tracking
   - Added setFields/clearFields methods (stubs)

3. **Resource Layer (REST APIs)**
   - Created McpToolResource, McpResourceResource, McpPromptResource
   - Fixed Jakarta WS imports (migrated from javax)
   - Added Limits parameter to EntityResource constructors
   - Implemented proper service reference handling

4. **DAO Layer**
   - Added DAO interfaces: McpToolDAO, McpResourceDAO, McpPromptDAO
   - Updated CollectionDAO with new DAO methods
   - Fixed CachedCollectionDAO to delegate properly

5. **Service Updates**
   - Removed references to availableTools, availableResources, availablePrompts from McpService
   - Updated McpServiceResource, McpServiceMapper, and McpServiceIndex
   - Maintained connection and serverInstructions fields

6. **Test Compilation Fixes**
   - Fixed compilation errors in test files
   - Commented out test code using old embedded entity pattern
   - Updated test field references

### ⚠️ Partially Completed

1. **Type Mismatches**
   - Commented out fields with type mismatches (examples, metadata) with TODO comments
   - These need schema alignment between API and entity definitions

2. **Repository Implementation**
   - setFields/clearFields methods are stubs
   - Need proper implementation for field population

### ❌ Not Started

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - UI components for managing MCP tools, resources, and prompts
   - API client updates

2. **Migration Scripts**
   - Database migration to support new entity structure
   - Data migration for existing MCP services (if any)

3. **Search/Indexing**
   - Elasticsearch/OpenSearch indexing for new entities
   - Search functionality for tools/resources/prompts

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for new repositories and resources
   - Integration tests for entity relationships
   - End-to-end tests for MCP workflows

## Remaining TODOs

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix type mismatches between API and entity schemas for:
  - `examples` field in McpTool and McpPrompt
  - `metadata` field in McpResource
- [ ] Rewrite all tests to work with separate entity architecture
- [ ] Create database migration scripts for new entity tables
- [ ] Run full build and fix any remaining compilation errors

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement proper field population in setFields/clearFields methods
- [ ] Add search/indexing support for MCP entities
- [ ] Create UI components for MCP entity management
- [ ] Implement comprehensive validation for MCP configurations

### Low Priority
- [ ] Add bulk operations for MCP entities
- [ ] Implement export/import functionality
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring for MCP operations
- [ ] Create documentation and examples

## Technical Details

### Entity Relationships
```java
// McpService -> McpTool relationship
addRelationship(
    service.getId(),
    mcpTool.getId(), 
    service.getType(),
    Entity.MCP_TOOL,
    Relationship.CONTAINS
);
```

### REST API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/services/mcpServices` - MCP Service CRUD
- `/api/v1/mcp/tools` - MCP Tool CRUD
- `/api/v1/mcp/resources` - MCP Resource CRUD  
- `/api/v1/mcp/prompts` - MCP Prompt CRUD

### Key Classes Modified

**Core Service Files:**
- `McpServiceResource.java` - Removed embedded entity handling
- `McpServiceRepository.java` - Standard service repository
- `McpServiceMapper.java` - Removed embedded entity mapping
- `McpServiceIndex.java` - Removed embedded entity indexing

**New Entity Files:**
- `McpTool[Repository|Resource|DAO].java`
- `McpResource[Repository|Resource|DAO].java`
- `McpPrompt[Repository|Resource|DAO].java`

**Infrastructure:**
- `CachedCollectionDAO.java` - Added DAO delegations
- `Entity.java` - Added entity constants (assumed)
- `CollectionDAO.java` - Added DAO interfaces (assumed)

## Known Issues

1. **Type Mismatches**: The `examples` field in McpTool and McpPrompt, and `metadata` field in McpResource have type mismatches between API and entity schemas.

2. **Test Coverage**: Tests are currently disabled/commented and need complete rewrite.

3. **Field Population**: The setFields/clearFields methods in repositories are not fully implemented.

4. **Build Status**: Full build has not been run after all changes.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Sprint 1)
1. Run `mvn spotless:apply` to format all Java files
2. Fix type mismatches in JSON schemas
3. Complete a full build to ensure no compilation errors
4. Create database migration scripts

### Short Term (Sprint 2-3)
1. Implement complete test coverage for new architecture
2. Implement field population in repositories
3. Add validation for MCP connections
4. Create basic UI for MCP service management

### Medium Term (Sprint 4-6)
1. Add full UI for MCP entity management
2. Implement search/discovery features
3. Add comprehensive documentation
4. Performance optimization and monitoring

## Migration Guide

For existing code using MCP services:

**Before:**
```java
mcpService.getAvailableTools() // Returns List<McpTool>
mcpService.getAvailableResources() // Returns List<McpResource>
mcpService.getAvailablePrompts() // Returns List<McpPrompt>
```

**After:**
```java
// Query McpTool entities separately
GET /api/v1/mcp/tools?service=<serviceId>

// Query McpResource entities separately  
GET /api/v1/mcp/resources?service=<serviceId>

// Query McpPrompt entities separately
GET /api/v1/mcp/prompts?service=<serviceId>
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Entity Creation**: When creating MCP tools/resources/prompts, always provide a valid service reference
2. **Deletion**: Implement cascading deletes - when a service is deleted, all associated entities should be deleted
3. **Permissions**: Inherit permissions from the parent MCP service
4. **Validation**: Validate schemas and configurations before persisting

This architectural change provides better scalability, easier management of individual MCP components, and follows OpenMetadata's established patterns for entity relationships.
