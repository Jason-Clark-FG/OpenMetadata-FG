You can find the GitHub release [here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/releases/tag/1.8.11-release).

## Breaking Changes

- **Deprecated inline assets field in Domain and Data Product entities.** The `assets` field is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the new paginated API endpoints instead: `GET /v1/domains/{id}/assets`, `GET /v1/domains/name/{name}/assets` and `GET /v1/dataProducts/{id}/assets`, `GET /v1/dataProducts/name/{name}/assets`.
- Introduced new paginated assets API endpoints for better performance with large asset collections. Python SDK users should migrate to use `ometa.get_domain_assets()` and `ometa.get_data_product_assets()` methods.

## Improvements

- Added new paginated assets API endpoints for Domain, Data Product, Glossary Term, Tag, Team, and User entities, providing improved performance and scalability when working with large asset collections.
- Introduced support for MF4 (Measurement Data Format version 4) file reader for automotive and industrial measurement data applications.
- Added support for clone queries in BigQuery lineage tracking to capture lineage for `CREATE TABLE ... CLONE` statements.
- Improved handling of nested column structures (subfields) in Datalake sources for more accurate schema representation.

## Fixes

- Fixed MF4 file reader import errors related to the `asammdf` library with proper lazy loading of dependencies.
- Resolved domain assets count mismatch between API and UI responses, ensuring accurate asset tracking.
- Pinned `pydantic` dependency to version `<2.12.0` to ensure compatibility and prevent potential breaking changes.
